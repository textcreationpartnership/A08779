         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In diuers Kingdoms, Prouinces and Cities, where the Goſpell of the Kingdom hath beene freely preached, where the Word hath raigned, they haue in a manner excluded him and his Kingdom, and ſubiected the people to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ſuperſtition, errour and ſeruitude: ſo that though Chriſt be now in his glorie, wee may as it were here him againe, &amp; againe complaining, and reſounding theeſe words againſt thoſe <hi>Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> that are cold in defending and maintaining his cauſe, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this world, for if my Kingdom were of this world, then would my Seruants fight that I ſhould not be deliuered</hi> in <hi>Garmanie, Bohemia, Sileſia, the Palatinate, Denmarke, Rochel,</hi> and other parts, to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> the <hi>French King,</hi> the <hi>King of Spaine</hi> and other Champions of the Romiſh religion; who ſubiect all they can to the Romiſh Beaſt and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: If my Kingdom were of this world that men might get <hi>Earldoms,</hi> Dukedoms and other places of proffit or honour by fighting for me, as the <hi>Duke of Bauaria, Spinola, Tillie</hi> and ſome others haue gotten by fighting on the contrarie part, then would my Seruants truly fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered in my Goſpel, my Kingdom, my Body, my Church and members to the Pope, and theeſe Popiſh Princes, that fight feircely to ſubiect people to him; as if I were euer to ſuffer, and as if Princes had beene perſwaded, that they doe God ſeruice, who doe not fight ſo earneſtly and ſeriouſly for me; but ſuffer me to be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to mine aduerſaries, Antichriſt and his Adherents. If there haue beene any ſuch perſwaders in Princes Courts, who to get money or preferment of ſome Popiſhly affected, haue hindred
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2471:37"/>timely ſupplies, by caſting in flattering ſcruples, exclaiming againſt theeſe defenſiue and aiding wars, extolling peace or the like, while the aduerſaries haue proceded and preuailed, they haue cauſe to feare, that the iuſt Iudge of all the world will finde this litle better then plaine treacherie; that howſeuer it may alſo be ſaide to them by Chriſt, <hi>my Kingdom is not of this world: for if my Kingdom were of this world then would</hi> theeſe be <hi>my Seruants,</hi> and <hi>fight for me;</hi> at leaſt by theire perſwaſions, councels and purſes, that I ſhould not be deliuered to Antichriſt or his champions.

<note place="margin">Act. 9.4.</note> that he that ſaide, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> is ſenſible of all the miſeries that his Church and euery member thereof, haue of late ſuffered by trecherie, officious flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, want of ſupplies or the like; and that he <hi>is yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame alſo for euer,</hi> in whoſe Word this is written, <hi>Curſe ye Meroz,

               <p>This man then that hoped that wee ſhould haue noe other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion then the booke of Articles and the common praier, hoped it ſeemes, that wee ſhould not haue them as they were at firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, nor in that which they require and binde men to. viz. in matter of faith and ſaluation to build only on the Scripture, which ye ſee is plainely and euidently intended by the compilers of the <hi>Articles.</hi> By this man one may gather the hopes of the Papiſts; for it was M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Burgen</hi> theire known <hi>Newes-monger,</hi> one that is <hi>frequent amonge them,</hi> and heares theire mindes; that preaching to aedifie ſome and confute others by Scripture; and writing to conuince ſome and eſtabliſh others, which haue ſoe weakened &amp; diſcoured them, would now be out of countenance and faſhion: that though
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2471:56"/>wee pray for theeſe things, yet there ſhould be nothing leſſe min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and practiſed; that ſoe they and the Arminians might preuaile vnconfuted, vnreproued; (becauſe theeſe bookes, though agreable to Scripture, are not, as ye ſee, warrants &amp; <hi>Rules</hi> of faith; they doe not quote places of Scripture to proue or confute, and ſo conſume Antichriſt and Hereticks by the Spirit of Chriſts mouth, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede recite all theire errours) that yet theeſe bookes would come to be the <hi>Rule</hi> of faith (and ſoe ouerthrow that which the 6. Article ſaies of the Scripture) that wee ſhould not ſoe much as vrge them in theire true &amp; grammaticall ſenſe; that by this meanes <hi>Arminian</hi> prelates might hold them to theire ſenſe; that if according to <hi>Trent</hi> practiſes, ſome more <hi>Arminians</hi> and Popelings could be intruded into Biſhops <hi>Sees</hi> and conuocations, then any thinge that they vnder the Name of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould teach or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, might alſo in time become rules and Articels of faith, and at laſt not the Scripture, but theire iniunctions ſhould be alleadged to proue points of faith, after the Manner of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Scriptures pinned to them, and in ſome points noe further admitted or taught then agreable to them: that inſteade of the authoritey of Scripture, the authoritie, ſenſe and iniunctions of the Church might be interpoſed, &amp; he iudged an Heretick that ſhould not receiue them, what euer they be, without further diſpute, and ſoe that wee ſhould ſhortly looſe our Religion, and all be brought by degrees and deuiſes, as the Churches of <hi>Italie</hi> and others were of old, to the Popes tenets. Whereas on the contrarie the booke of Articles ſaith, Art. 19. <hi>The viſſible Church of Chriſt is a congregation of faithfull men, in which the pure Word of God is preached and the Sacraments be duly ministred according to Chriſts ordinance.</hi> Art. 20. <hi>The Church heath power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and authoritie in controuerſies of faith: And yet it is not lawfull for the Church to ordaine any thinge that is contrarie to Gods Word written, neither may it ſoe expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another. Wherefore although the Church be a witnes and a keeper of holy writ: Yet as it ought not to decree any thinge againſt the ſame, ſo beſides the ſame, ought it not to enforce any thinge to be beleeued for neceſſity of ſaluation.</hi> Art. 21. <hi>Generall councells may erre, and ſomtime haue erred.</hi> Much more particular.</p>

               <p>Thus then the booke of common prayer &amp; the Articles binde Men to be of Gods Truth: neither doth any man rightly hold them, vnleſſe as they require, he in matters of faith and ſaluation keepe to the Scripture, and ſo be of the Truth. Thoſe men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſlight or neglect the due preaching of Gods Word, and the conuincing of Hereticks by it; and inſteade thereof ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and extoll the booke of common praier, and the Articles and conſtitutions of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that they ſeeme to haue litle or noe Religion beſides;
